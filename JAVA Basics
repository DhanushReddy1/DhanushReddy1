How to Create Class:-   To create the class, we use the keyword "class" and then we keep name to that class as "Main".
                        
                        Example:- public class Main {
                                   int x = 25;
                                     }
                                     
How to Create Object:-  In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named "Main", so now we can use this to create objects.

                        To create an object of Main, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword "new".   

                        Example:- public class Main {
                                    int x = 15;
                      public static void main(String[] args) {
                          Main myObj = new Main();
                         System.out.println(myObj.x);
                           }
                           }
                           
How to Create Method:-    In Java, to create a method, we should declare a Method name within the class and that they are used to perform certain actions.

                        Example:-   public class Main {
                                         static void newMethod() {
                                       System.out.println("Hello World!");
                                         }
                                         }
                                         
How to Create Signature:- The getInstance() method of the Signature class accepts a string parameter representing required signature algorithm and returns the respective Signature object.                                       
                            
                         Example:- Signature sign = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withDSA");
